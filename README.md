## Multi Language Support

**[EN]** Due to the high usage of the bot on Turkish servers, the default language of the bot is set to *Turkish*.
You can change the language of the bot in the server with the command `!alocale set <language-code>`

**[TR]** Botun yüksek oranda Türk sunucularında kullanılmasından dolayı botun varsıyılan dili *Türkçe* olarak
ayarlanmıştır. Botun sunucu içerisinde ki dilini `!alocale set <dil-kodu>` komutu ile değiştirebilirsiniz.

Example to make the bot's default language English:
```sh
!asetlocale set en
```

## Self-Hosting ‍‼️

Asena is any software that does not generate revenue. All features are offered for free.
But for those who insist on hosting their own; The reason bot codes are open source is to help other developers who want to code the bot, to see the working principle and to contribute to those who want to solve the bot's software problems. Other than that, you cannot host the bot yourself in any way. This is a violation of rights.
Otherwise, no assistance will be provided to edit, compile or generate any code in this repository.
